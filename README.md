## Statements on version 1.x

I uploaded version 1.x without any proper testing. Because of this, the app did not work at all. I have yanked all versions under 1.x as none of them currently work. Over the past week, more than 30 people have downloaded `seecrets`. To all of those people, I would like to apologize.

Everyone who, can should upgrade to version 2.0.0
